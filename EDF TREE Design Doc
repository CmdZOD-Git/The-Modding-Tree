##Mission mini-game

###Layer 1 : your progress vs progess target
* to complete mission you must complete X steps
* to comple a step you must acquire X progress point
* Progress points come from actor (read hero and allies) weapons and gear (mainly)

###Layer 2 : the Actor mini-game
* Steps list Actor on the scene
* Each actor can have an effect on base progress
* Each actor has a number, a list of equipment, a name and possibly TAGS to react to

_Exemple :
GOOD ACTOR
- 1 Hero [LEVEL get hero level],[HERO]
- 2 Medium Tanks [LEVEL 25],[VEHICLE, HEAVY]
- 15 Allied soldiers [LEVEL 10],[INFANTRY]
- 3 HQ support [LEVEL 10],[TURRET]

NEUTRAL ACTOR
- Civilians
- Buildings
- Props
- Things to recover

BAD ACTOR
- 120 ANTS [LEVEL 10],[BUGS, ANTS]
- 50 SPIDER [LEVEL 10],[BUGS, SPIDER]
- 30 FLIES [LEVEL 10],[BUGS, FLYING, WASP]
- 5 GIANT ROBOT [LEVEL 30],[GIANT, ROBOT]
- 1 BOSS [LEVEL 45],[BOSS, GIANT, ETHER]
- ...

###Layer 3 : the event mini-game
* Every few seconds there is an event
* Events are drawn from a pool
* Pool is generated at each step, ACTORS, EQUIPMENT and MISSON put events in the pool
* With upgrades you acquire more ability to manipulate the event pool
* Some events have a limite amount they can be fired before being removed from the pool
* Gameplay note : Be very careful of number of events, should be low enough to make sense
* Equipment idea :
	- Rifleman weapon : put to pool a certain number of weapon events
	- On fire, weapon events are looked by META ACTOR (the equipped weapon) and fire an effect (or an off-screen event)
	- On weapon switch : make sure that you use two step event (weapon event and the meta watcher) and that the number of events is not defined by the weapon itself (but by the class itself for exemple)

###Layer 4 : the THREAT mini-game
* THREAT is a gauge going between current THREAT and THREAT CAP
* Each second there is a calculation between THREAT generated by BAD actors and THREAT removed by good ACTORS
* THREAT is basically a muliplier tied to a sliding scale
* if you spend too much time over THREAT CAP mission is reset (so there is a LOSE CASE), think of it as a grind wall to have a THREAT CAP and THREAT RECOVERY good enough to push through missions
